        Celestial bodies or heavenly bodies are objects in space such as the sun, moon, planets, and stars. They form a part of the vast universe we live in and are usually very far from us. The glorious night sky is dotted with such objects and when we observe them using a telescope, they reveal fascinating worlds of their own.

Hence, we can define heavenly bodies as,

A planet, moon, star or other natural objects in the space.
Celestial bodies are also termed as heavenly bodies. These are the objects in our space like sun, moon, planets, and many stars. These are forming a part of the vast universe in which we are living. The glorious night sky is having dotted appearance with such objects. When anyone observes them using the telescope, these are looking very fascinating. As these are so far away, we cannot see all of them using our naked eye. Thus we need the telescopes to study them.

Our universe is containing an amazing collection of celestial objects or astronomical objects. Though most of the observable cosmos is composed of the empty space. Still, this cold, dark void which is sparsely populated by the number of astronomical objects. These are ranging from the common to the bizarre. These are the stuff which is filled with the empty space of the universe.
